  Dimsum is an ideology, a culture born through perfection of a culinary style.

  The term Dimsum was first seen in Chinese text over a thousand years ago  referring to small snacks.   It  first  carried the meaning 'Gratitude' and  literally  means 'Touching the  Heart'.

  Dimsum  is delicate,  requiring  skilful craftmanship. Each kind of  Dimsum has its own set  of  standard. For example, the popular Shrimp Dumpling (Har  Gau)  should have at least 8 folds  with thin  skin close to translucent. A chef  may take  decades of experience  to perfect a Har  Gau.

  Dimsim is an art. It is to appreciate from the shape, colour,  smell,  temperature,  taste and texture. Each part of  a  dimsum  reflects the perfection of details:  from  the  skin, filling, form till  to  how  it is served.

  Dimsum  is more than a  form of  culinary  art, it  reflects the ideology of Tao. It is a practice of Zen when one's  movement  and  mind integrate harmoniously with the  piece of  dimsum in hand.
